## Solution

Starting with reading the description of the challenge it notified us about SSTI feng shui, so it's probably a server side template injection vulnerability

![challinfo](1.png "Challenge Info")

Looking at the files we see PHP is used with Twig, which is a is a template engine for PHP. The web page provide us a form to register a name. Registering a name we get a greeting response with the value we passed to it.

So we start exploiting this vulnerability with a very simple payload, {{7*7}}, to check if it's going to evaluate so we have the following:
`http://docker.hackthebox.eu:31119/?name={{7*7}}`
And we get back 49! So it's vulnerable to SSTI.

Now we can get remote code execution and list the root folder with the following payload:

`{{['ls /']|filter('system')}}`

We see the flag file there so we just need to read it:

`{{['cat /flag']|filter('system')}}`
